## Introduction
This application is an example implementation for [my guide on Medium](https://medium.com/@nielskersic/automatic-monitoring-application-with-nodejs-playwright-and-google-sheets-a62875b1ce98) about monitoring values with Playwright and logging them to Google Sheets.

## Details
This example application is written in TypeScript and uses Playwright and the Google Sheets API to scrape and log values from an [example website](https://scraping-target.niels.codes).

The application includes a Dockerfile for deployment to Cloud Run.
